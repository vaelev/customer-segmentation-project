# Customer Segmentation with k-Means

This project focuses on creating a clustering model for customer segmentation in the context of a test demo online shop called "sustainable-fit.com". The project follows the key phases of the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) model and presents the findings in a detailed management briefing.

The project includes the following components:

1. Business Understanding & Marketing Data Science Canvas:
   - Analysis of the business case and use case for the customer segmentation project
   - Identification of the project's potential for practical application
   - Definition of success metrics and critical project parameters
   - Recommendations for project implementation within the company

2. Dataset & Cleaning, Preparation:
   - Utilization of a fictitious, largely cleaned dataset provided as a CSV file (or an alternative dataset)
   - Exploratory data analysis and data screening with interpretations using techniques such as box plots and correlation matrices
   - Data preprocessing, including handling outliers and data cleaning

3. Modeling:
   - Development of a clustering model using the k-means algorithm in Python
   - Implementation of k-means from scratch and using the scikit-learn library
   - Visualization of the clustering results using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn
   - Iterative process of feature selection and cluster number adaptation to obtain an explainable model

4. Evaluation & Deployment:
   - Assessment of the clustering model's results compared to the previous situation without machine learning
   - Presentation of key findings, including model performance, limitations, and practical applications
   - Recommendations for further actions and stakeholder engagement to create project acceptance

The project utilizes various Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning, including:
- NumPy: Numerical computing library
- Matplotlib: Data visualization library
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library, used for k-means clustering and data preprocessing

The repository includes the following files and folders:
- `data/`: Contains the CSV dataset used for the project
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, preprocessing, and clustering (does not include the code of the first iteration with full k-Means implementation but screenshots of it are part of the project paper)
- `docs/`: Contains the project instructions and the project paper / management briefing document presenting the project findings and recommendations
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, and key findings

This project demonstrates the application of data analytics and machine learning techniques for customer segmentation in an e-commerce context. It showcases the use of Python and popular data science libraries for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization, and presents the results in a management-friendly format.

Feel free to explore the repository and the associated files to gain insights into the customer segmentation process and the potential benefits it offers for the "sustainable-fit.com" online shop.
