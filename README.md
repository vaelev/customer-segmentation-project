# Customer Segmentation with k-Means

This project focuses on creating a clustering model for customer segmentation in the context of a test demo online shop called "sustainable-fit.com". The project follows the key phases of the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) model and presents the findings in a detailed management briefing.

The project includes the following components:

1. Business Understanding & Marketing Data Science Canvas
2. Dataset & Cleaning, Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation

The repository includes the following files and folders:
- `data/`: Contains the CSV dataset used for the project
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, preprocessing, and clustering (does not include the code of the first iteration with full k-Means implementation but screenshots of it are part of the project paper)
- `docs/`: Contains the project instructions and the project paper / management briefing document presenting the project findings and recommendations
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, and key findings
